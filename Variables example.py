- Intro

- Variables are one of the most useful tools a programmer has.

- There are three main things you can do with variables: define, assign, manipulate

- The four basic types of variables are int, float, string, and bool.

- Int stands for integer, and works with whole number values that can be used in computations

- Float stands for floating point number, which is a number with a decimal

- Str stands for string, which is a series of characters and letters

- Bool stands for boolean, which is a truth value. It can either be true or false. These are used to evaluate a condition
which we will learn about in a later lesson

- Naming variables and naming errors

- You can print variables by using the print command we learned about in the last lesson (show how to do it)

- You can also print the result of an operation on two variables (show print(x+y))

- Be careful if you are trying to print a string and an int at the same time. Python only lets you print type string
with other type strings. To fix this error it will give you, cast the int as type str to let it be printed (show this)

- Maybe something else?
