"""Mr. Myerscough's commenting example:
This will show you how to write comments in python, and how to
properly comment your code.

Commenting in code is very important. Each person codes with a 
different style, just like how different people write with 
different styles. This can make reading someone elses code 
very confusing. To remedy this, we comment our code so someone else
can tell why you coded things the way you did."""

#To write a single line comment, you use the "#" symbol. If you did
#it correctly, the text should be green. 
#Notice that I have to write the "#" before each line.
#Single line comments should be used for small blocks of code.

#This line prints a message to the user
print("Welcome to Intro to Programming!")

#To write a multi-line comment, you use three quotation marks in
#a row. An example is the intro comment to this program.
#If you did it correctly, your text should turn orange.

"""In a multi-line comment, anything I write will be included
in this comment. It doesn't matter if I put spaces in between

L
I
K
E

T
H
I
S

All of it ends up being in the comment. This type of comment is
used at the beginning of code to explain what the entire program
does, and can be used before very large blocks of code or 
fuctions to explain what they do overall. Your code should always
start with a multi-line comment to explain what it does. To end
a multi-line comment, you put three more quotation marks."""
