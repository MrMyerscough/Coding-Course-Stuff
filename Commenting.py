""" Video Notes

- Intro

- Commenting in code is one of the most important pieces of your code. These are notes enclosed in a special symbol that python overlooks
when running your code. Anything you write will not be run.

- Coding is like writing a paper or a novel: Each person writes with a different style and uses different syntax. Without comments,
someone else may not be able to understand your code.

- Proper commenting is important, and we'll go through some guidelines.

- Single line comments are written using the #. If you did this correctly, the text will turn green. This is for a short comment,
used for a small section of code or a short description (Example)

- Multi line comments are written using three quotation marks or three apostrophes in a row, and closed the same way. If you use
quotation marks to open it, make sure you also use quotation marks to close it. (Example)

- Multi line comments are used to explain a large block of code, or an entire program. These can be multiple lines long, as the name
suggests. A comment should be at the beginning of each of your programs that explains the program and what it does.
