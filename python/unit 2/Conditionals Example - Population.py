# 2.1 - Conditionals (2nd practice)
# In this practice there will be 4 different tasks to complete using 
# conditionals. Make sure to run your code in between each task 
# to make sure that the program is working correctly before moving on.

# Task 1: Create a program that will print the population if it is less than 10,000,000
# population_1 should print, and population_2 and population_3 shouldn't print

population_1 = 5000000


population_2 = 20000000


population_3 = 30000000


# Task 2: Create a program that will print the population if it is between 10,000,000 and 25,000,000
# population_2 should print, and population_1 and population_3 shouldn't print

population_1 = 5000000


population_2 = 20000000


population_3 = 30000000



# Task 3: Create a program that will print "Densely populated" if the land area (number of 
# people per unit area) is greater than 100. You should get 1 print of densely populated 
# for land_area_2 and no output for land_area_1

land_area_1 = 50


land_area_2 = 105


# Task 4: Create a program that will print "Densely populated" if the land area is greater 
# than 100, and "Sparsely populated" otherwise you should get 1 print of sparsely populated 
# for land_area_1, followed by 1 print of densely populated for land_area_2

land_area_1 = 50


land_area_2 = 105
