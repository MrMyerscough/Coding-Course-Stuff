# 2.1 - Conditionals
# In this practice there will be 4 different tasks to complete using 
# conditionals. Make sure to run your code in between each task 
# to make sure that the program is working correctly before moving on.

# Task 1: Ask the user to guess the magic number. If they enter the same value 
# as the magic_number variable, print "You guessed it!" If they enter anything 
# else, print "That isn't it! The magic number is 21."
magic_number = 21



# Task 2: Ask the user if they like dogs and store their response as a variable. 
# If they enter "yes", print "I'm glad you like dogs!" If they enter "no", print 
# "What's wrong with you??". If they enter anything else, print "That's not an 
# answer! Enter yes or no."



# Task 3: Ask the user to type in a sentence. Using the length of the string,
# print if the string is long (greater than or equal to 50 characters) or 
# short (less than 50 characters). 



# Task 4: Ask the user for two numbers. Using an if statement, print which
# number is the biggest of the two. If the user inputs 5 and 12, the 
# output should be '12 is bigger than 5'. If the numbers are equal, print
# that they are the same.
