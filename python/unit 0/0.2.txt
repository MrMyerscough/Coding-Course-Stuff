Today I'm going to show you how to install and set up visual studio code and python.

So if you don't know VS Code is a great code editor, and it's where we'll be writing our python programs. It's awesome because it has a bunch of powerful tools that both beginners and advanced programmers can use. 

Python is the programming language we're using for Intro to Coding. There are many different programming languages out there, but this one is pretty easy to get the hang of. 

You'll need to install both of these onto your computer before you get started coding. 

With a google search you should find what you're looking for. Download and install them depending on your operating system.

If you're on windows, when you run the Python installer, there might be a checkbox at the bottom saying 'add python to path'. Make sure that's checked. 

Okay. Once you have those installed, we need to set up VS Code. Go ahead and open it. It'll look something like this.

To get python working we'll need to install a few extensions. This icon is for the marketplace. Click it and then search for python.

This one, made by Microsoft, is the one we want to use. Click install. 

You'll also want to have code runner. Search and install that too. It looks like this.

Once those are done installing, click reload.

Okay. In the menu, click view, command pallet. Type in 'python select interpreter.'

Click the one with the latest version because there might be more than one.
