# 3.4 - File I/O
# In this example there will be 3 different tasks to complete using 
# File I/O. Make sure to run your code in between each task 
# to make sure that program is working correctly before moving on.


# Task 1: Create a text file from the following lines. Then access
# that text file and read its contents. Print out every number in the 
# file to the terminal with 14 added to it. 

# ===
12
55
23
44
27
# === 

# your output should look like:

26
69
37
58
41



# Task 2: Create a program that takes user input and writes it to a 
# file. When the user hits enter, it should start a new line in the 
# text file. Stop taking input when the user types in 'exit'.



# Task 3: Create a text file from the following lines. Then access
# that text file and read its contents. Capitalize every name from
# the text file and then write it to a separate output file. You
# will need to have two file objects ('with' statements) in this
# program. Nothing should be outputted to the terminal
