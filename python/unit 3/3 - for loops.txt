last time we looked at while loops, the first type of loop in python.
today, we're looking at for-loops. the second type of loop.

for loops are more specific than while loops, but still very very useful. 

they're built for sequences, so before you start looping, you'll need
a sequence first. i'll use a string, and set that to x.

then we can write our for-loop. start with the keyword 'for'. 
follow that with the name of a new variable. i'll name mine 
'letter' and you'll see why in a second. then the keyword 'in'
followed by your sequence and a colon. 

we learned about the 'in' operator in our lists lesson, but don't get 
confused, this means something different. 

you probably guessed it: after your colon, you can start a block on the
following lines. 

so what does the for loop do? and how many times does it repeat?

the for loop will repeat it's block for every item in the sequence
~~and it gives you what the item is in a variable. that variable
is the one you named right before the word 'in', so in this program
it's 'letter'.

in the block, i'm just going to simply print letter. 
let's look at the output.

x = 'hello'

for letter in x:
    print(letter)

[run]

as you can see, the loop ran 5 times, and the value of letter
changed 

this is called iteration.
