last time we looked at while loops, the first type of loop in python.
today, we're looking at for-loops. the second type of loop.

for loops are more specific than while loops, but still very useful. 

they're built for sequences, so before you start looping, you'll need
a sequence. i'll use a string, and set that to x.

then we can write our for-loop. start with the keyword 'for'. 
follow that with the name of a new variable. i'll name mine 
'letter' and you'll see why in a second. then the keyword 'in'
followed by your sequence and a colon. 

we learned about the 'in' operator in our lists lesson, but don't get 
confused, this means something different. 

you probably guessed it: after your colon, you can start a block on the
following lines. 

so what does the for loop do? and how many times does it repeat?

the for loop will repeat it's block for every item in the sequence

in the block, i'm just going to simply print 'hi'. 
let's look at the output.

x = 'hello'

for letter in x:
    print('hi')

[run]

as you can see, the loop ran 5 times, so we have 5 prints in the terminal.
it ran 5 times because x is five items long. pretty simple.

the for loop also gives you which item it's looping over. 
this value is stored in the variable you specified, right 
before the word 'in'. In this case, the variable is letter.

instead of printing "hi's" let's print letter.

x = 'hello'

for letter in x:
    print(letter)

[run]

the value of 'letter' changed each time the block ran. 
it started with the first item in the sequence
and ended with the last.

this is called iteration. 
the loop runs through each item in the sequence, or iterates over it. 

also notice how if you read the instruction like a sentence, it kinda makes sense.
'for every letter in x, do whatever. or in this case print.'

let's look at an example using a list.

animals = ['cow', 'fish', 'bird', 'giraffe', 'shark', 'dog']

for animal in animals:
    print(animal)

this is the exact same setup, except it uses a list of animals instead
of letters. 

[run]

loops let you do cool things with sequences because they don't depend on 
a set number of items. 

test_scores = [96, 100, 82, 84, 93, 100]

total = 0

for score in test_scores:
    total = total + score

average = total / len(test_scores)

print('the average is', average)

[run]

this program starts with a list of numbers, which holds test scores. 
then a variable called total is used to keep track of the sum of all test scores.
the for loop goes through every number in the list, and adds it to the
total variable. 
after the loop runs, we find the average by dividing the total by the length
of the list. 

when i run this you can see that we get the expected output.
like i said, a for loop doesn't depend on a set number of items,
so if i add 6 more test scores to the list, the program still runs
completely fine. 

sometimes, however, you do want a for loop to depend on a set number, and 
you can achieve that with the range command. 

[open interpreter]

the range command returns a sequence of numbers that you can use in a for loop.
to see things more clearly, i'll cast to a list in the interpreter.
it's pretty straightforward. if you want a sequence that's 10 items long,
call the range command with the number 10 as an argument. 
the returned sequence starts at zero and ends at 9, for 10 total items.
likewise, if you want 50, give it 50. it'll take whichever number. 

it's a weird idea, i know, but just like most things in programming, the 
range command returns a sequence starting at zero instead of one. this is helpful with lists
later on. 

list( range(10) )

list( range(50) )

list( range(20) )

if you want it to count from one number to another number, you can specify
a start and end to the sequence. if i give it 10 and 20, it'll start at 10
and end at 19, again 10 items long.

list( range(10, 20) )

list( range(5, 25) )

if we try to count backwards, say from 10 to negative 10, it doesn't return 
any numbers in the list, and that's because by default, it counts /up by /one.
to change the amount it counts by, give it a third number. in this case, 
giving -1 will count down by ones. 

list( range(10, -10) )

list( range(10, -10, -1) )

this is handy if you want to count in 10s or even numbers, or negative multiples of 7,
or whatever you'd like. 

list( range(0, 100, 10) )
list( range(10, 30, 2) )
list( range(49, 0, -7) )

that's about all there is to the range command, so let's see how it would work
in a for loop program. 

of course you can make counting loops of all different kinds; but we did that with while loops,
which wasn't very exciting

for i in range(10):
    print(i)

this program prints out items in two lists at once. 

x = ['green', 'yellow', 'red', 'blue', 'orange']
y = ['apple', 'lemon', 'strawberry', 'raspberry', 'orange']

for i in range( len(x) ):
    color = x[i]
    flavor = y[i]
    print(color, 'is', flavor, 'flavored!')

here we have two corresponding lists, where they are the same length, and an 
item in one list has a value that pairs with it, at the same position in the 
other list. that means 'green' goes with 'apple' and 'red' goes with 'strawberry'

because you can't make a for loop that goes over two items from different lists,
 i instead made the loop go over the range of the list. 
this way, it counts to the length of the list, starting from zero. 
i use that index to select an item from /both lists/ and then print it out.
this lets me access two or more items at the same time.




for loops are also an easy way to make modified versions of lists.
let's say you have a list of booleans, and you want to flip each value
in the list. there's not really an easy way of doing this; you /have
to go through each item and flip them one by one. fortunately, for 
loops are great at that. 

i'll do this two ways.

values = [True, True, False, True, False, False]

# making a new list
new_values = []

for value in values:
    new_values.append( not value )

print('old list:')
print(values)
print('new list:')
print(new_values)

# keeping the old list

for i in range(len(values)):
    values[i] = not values[i]

print('modified original list:')
print(values)

the first way, i'm going through each item in the list,
flipping the value, and then adding that on to a new list,
called new values. this way, i end up with a modified list
and an unmodified list. you might need that, depending on your
program.

the second way, i just change the original list to have different 
values. instead of looping through every item, i loop through 
the range, and then set the item at the index to the opposite value. 

[run?]

at first, you might want to loop over the list like normal,
and then set the variable to the new value, but that actually
doesn't work. >_<

print('old list:')
print(values)

for value in values:
    value = not value

print('resulting list:')
print(values)

modifying the given variable doesn't do anything, because it's just
a copy of the item in the list. 

okay.
by now, we're starting to make useful programs that accept all types of data. 
let's write a simple algorithm to find the largest number in a list. 
and by the way, an algorithm is just a set of steps that solves a class of 
problems. 

to find the largest number in a set, you'll need to compare them to 
each other. 

here's how it works.
after my list of numbers i create a variable called 'largest' and set it to zero.
then i simply loop through each number in the list. 
if the number is greater than the one in the 'largest' variable, that number
then becomes the largest. since it'll go through every number in the list,
it will find the greatest number out of all of them, as long as it's above zero. 

numbers = [1, 523, 6.3, 1541, 203, 4, 28, -12, 1358]

largest = 0

for number in numbers:
    if number > largest:
        # print to show what is going on
        print(f'{number} is greater than {largest}. now it's the largest!')
        largest = number

print('the largest number is', largest)

cool! it worked. 

in the output, it shows how it went through each number in the list, and kept track of the
biggest value. 

now you can use this piece of code to find the largest number
in a list, if you ever needed to. or you could use python's built in max
function, that does the exact same thing. (lol)

largest = max(numbers)

print(largest)

but the idea carries: for loops can be used to compare items in a set.
think about how you could modify this program to find the longest string out of
a list of strings. python doesn't have a built in function for that. 


lastly, you may also want to nest for loops in certain cases.
since one loop can compare values in one list, you can use nested loops to 
compare values in two lists. here's a common use case.

math_students = ['matt', 'barry', 'alyssa', 'aliza', 'carl', 'john', 'beth', 'nate', 'hannah', 'drew']

art_students = ['molly', 'katie', 'carl', 'jake', 'hannah', 'lila', 'noah', 'barry', 'sean', 'carlos']

let's say we have two lists of names. one is full of the students in math class,
and the second is the students in art class. how can we find which students are 
in both classes?

you'd have to go through every name in the first list, and look if there's a 
matching name in the second list. in this example each list only has 10 
names, but if it was more like 100 names, or larger, it would take forever
to find. instead, we can use nested for loops.

math_students = ['matt', 'barry', 'alyssa', 'aliza', 'carl', 'john', 'beth', 'nate', 'hannah', 'drew']

art_students = ['molly', 'katie', 'carl', 'jake', 'hannah', 'lila', 'noah', 'barry', 'sean', 'carlos']

students_in_both = []

for math_student in math_students:
    for art_student in art_students:
        if math_student == art_student:
            students_in_both.append(math_student)

print('the following students are in both math and art:')
for student in students_in_both:
    print(student)

in this program, i go through every single student in math class. then, 
for each math student, i go through each art student. if the two names
are equal, then the student is in both classes, and I add that name to
a list that will remember those students. when the nested loop finishes,
i print the smaller list again with a for loop. pretty practical. 

notice how i use different names for each loops' variables. that's because 
you cant really keep track of two things with only one name.


nested for-loops are also a way to iterate over every item in a two-dimensional list;
that's just a list where each item is another list. let's look at this program


grid = [
    [1,  2,  3,  4],
    [5,  6,  7,  8],
    [9,  10, 11, 12],
    [13, 14, 15, 16]
]

here we have a 2D list which is 4x4 items large. 

to access a single item, first you need to select one of the smaller lists,
which kind of act as rows in a grid. 
once you select that list, then you can select an item from it, using a second
selector. think of it like the first number selecting the row and the second
number selecting the column. 

this is how you'd print the 2nd item in the 3rd row. 

** graphics label the positions **

item = grid[2][1]

using that concept, we can use for loops to print every item in the entire grid.

for row in grid:
    for item in row:
        print(item)

for every row in the grid, and every item in that row, print the item. cool. 



i know that was a lot of use cases in a single video, but that's because for
loops can be used in many places, and they're pretty handy. 

take a chance to practice what you've seen here, and pretty soon you'll 
master iteration. 

alright. 
code dog out.
