# 3.2 - While Loops
# In this example there will be 4 different tasks to complete using 
# While Loops. Make sure to run your code in between each task 
# to make sure that program is working correctly before moving on.


# Task 1: Create a program that counts to 27
# Your program should use a while loop, and keep increasing the variable 
# each time the loop runs



# Task 2: Create a program that counts backwards from 20 to -10 by twos
# Your program should print 20, 18, 16, 14 ... -6, -8, -10 using a while loop.



# Task 3: Create a menu that lets the user pick from 3 options, and only ends 
# when the user selects the end option. Write this using a boolean variable
# to stop the program.



# Task 4: Create an empty list variable called 'things'. Ask the user to 
# enter in an object, and add it to the list. Keep asking the user and
# adding to the list until the user types in 'stop'. Then print out the list.
