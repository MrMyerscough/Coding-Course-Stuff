# 3.1 - Lists
# In this example there will be 6 different tasks to complete using 
# Lists. Make sure to run your code in between each task 
# to make sure that program is working correctly before moving on.

ids = [4353, 2314, 2956, 3382, 9362, 3900]

# Task 1: Remove 3382 from your list.
# When printed, the list should no longer have 3382 in it


print(ids)

# Task 2: Get the index of 9362.
# When printed, you should have the index number of 9362



# Task 3: Insert 4499 in the list after 9362. This should work
# wherever 9362 is placed in the list.  When printed, the list 
# should have 4499 directly after 9362. HINT: the insert
# should depend on the index of 9362. 



print(ids)

# Task 4: Extend the list by adding [5566, 1830] to it
# When printed, the list should have 5566 and 1830 added to the end of it


print(ids)

# Task 5: Reverse the list.
# When printed, the list should be backwards from the list in task 4


print(ids)

# Task 6: Sort the list.
# When printed, the list should be sorted numerically (Smallest number first)


print(ids)
