hey guys - quick and short video here on comments in python

soon you'll be writing big programs, and they can get confusing sometimes.
comments can help you keep track of what's going on, and it'll make your
programs more readable for other people too.

comments let you write anything you want inside of a program, but they should
mostly be used to explain what's going on.

use the number sign to signify you're writing a comment. this tells
the program that it is *not* a command, and to ignore what comes after it.

as you can see i have comments at the top telling what this program is and where it came from.


you might also want to use comments to disable a part of your code while you
test things out. there's a handy shortcut in VS code that comments things out.
select what you want and then use CTRL + / on windows  or CMD + / on mac.

there's also a way you can have a giant comment across many lines, but this is
actually used for official documentation, and we'll learn about that when we
get to functions and classes. 

okay thats all for now. code dog out.
