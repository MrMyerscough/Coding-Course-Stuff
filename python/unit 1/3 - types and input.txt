text input AND operators?

last time we learned about variables, and we slightly touched on 
variable types. today we're going to learn a little bit more about
types, what you can do with them, and the input command.

#int 
10
234930
-342

#float
-32.123
0.0
12.1

#str
"what's up?"
'hi 1239)*@!29103-_%*'
''

#bool
True
False


so these are the main types in Python, int, float, str, and bool.
here are a few more examples of those. these are all valid.
these values, however, don't do much on their own.

that's what operators do. operators, well, preform operations. 
let's do a little math

[for these, start out by only writing the expressions, and add the prints later.]

print(5 + 10.4)
print(5.34 - 10)
print(5.1 * 10)
print(5 / -1.0)

this is your standard add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
use the asterisk for multiplication and a slash for division.
if we print these, nothing too surprising happens.

print(5 ** 2)
print(5 // 2)
print(5 % 2)

these are three more operations, and they're a little more unique.
this one is how you write an exponent in python. this means 5 squared.
this one is called integer division or floor division. when you divide
something, this will always return the whole number quotient, and throw 
out the remainder if there is one.
this last one is called modulo. it's kind of the opposite of integer divison.
instead of only returning the quotient, it only returns the remainder.


str.capitalize(   str.format(       str.isidentifier( 
str.ljust(        str.rindex(       str.strip(       
str.casefold(     str.format_map(   str.islower(      
str.lower(        str.rjust(        str.swapcase(    
str.center(       str.index(        str.isnumeric(    
str.lstrip(       str.rpartition(   str.title(       
str.count(        str.isalnum(      str.isprintable(  
str.maketrans(    str.rsplit(       str.translate(   
str.encode(       str.isalpha(      str.isspace(      
str.mro(          str.rstrip(       str.upper(       
str.endswith(     str.isascii(      str.istitle(      
str.partition(    str.split(        str.zfill(       
str.expandtabs(   str.isdecimal(    str.isupper(      
str.replace(      str.splitlines(   str.find(         
str.isdigit(      str.join(         str.rfind(        
str.startswith(  

these are all the operations you can do on a string.
as you can see, theres a lot, and you can look up what they do if you'd like,
but we're only going to talk about a few.


"hello" + " " + "person"
"hello" * 3

you can add strings together to make one bigger string, and you can also
multiply strings to repeat something. subtracting and dividing strings
will just give you errors.

these are special operations. as you can see, i take a value and then
attach a command to the end with a dot. 

"   hello    ".strip()
"hELLo".lower()
"hELLo".upper()
"my name is jack".replace('jack', 'dog')

these operations are commands built into the string data type.

str.lower("hELLo")

you can also write them like this, and that might make a little more sense
since we learned that the values you give to a command goes inside of
the parenthesis. 

we put 'str' before the command because 'str' is the class where 
the 'lower' command is stored.

when we do the operation directly on the value,
it's sort of like a short way of writing this. we'll learn more about
how this actually works when we get to objects in a later unit. 

if we print these, you'll see that 'strip' removes extra white space,
lower turns everything to lowercase, and upper turns everything to 
uppercase. 
**the replace command will replace all occurrences of the 
first parameter with the second parameter.


#sequence operations

len("hi there!")
"hello"[4]
"hello"[2:4]
"this is a sentence"[5:]
"this is a sentence"[:4]
"this is a sentence"[120]

***
these are more operations you can do with strings. 
well, you can actually use these on all sequence data types.
a sequence is just a list of items, so a string is
actually a list of letters. every sequence starts
from zero instead of one.

***
len stands for length. it'll return the length of the string.
you use these to chop up a string into pieces.
inside of the brackets a single number will return that item in the sequence.
two numbers with a colon between them will give you the items in between
those indexes.
a colon after a number will give you the item and all the others after it.
a colon before gives you the items before it.

cool. now lets move on to booleans.
since booleans are just a truth statement, we can actually write
comparisons and see if they end up true or false. here are a few examples.

5 == 5
4 == 5
4 != 5
3.2 > 1
14 < 82.6
13 >= 13
32 <= 12
'hi' == 'hi'
"hello" == "HELLO"
"code" != "dog"
"a lot of words" > "one"
"h" < ""
True == True
False == True

python will evaluate these and tell us if it is true or false.
remember, we use one equal sign to define and assign variables,
so we use two equal signs to tell python we're making a comparison.
an exclamation before an equal sign checks if the two values are not equal.
we can also check if something is greater than or less than.
this means greater than or equal to and this means less than or equal to.
you can check if strings are the same or if one is longer than the other.
lets print these.

that was pretty basic. all python did was tell us if the comparison was 
true or false.

there are also logical operators in coding. here's what they look like.

not True
not False

True and True
True and False
False and False

True or True
True or False
False or False

the 'not' word negates, or flips, the boolean.
true becomes false and false becomes true.

the 'and' tells us if both are true and the 'or' tells us if one
or both is true.

a little confusing? hang in there. things will clear up soon.

you'll also have to know about casting. casting is changing a value
from one type to another.

my_age = 24
how_old = my_age + " years old"
print(how_old)

so lets say you have a program and you want to take a number and then
add it to a string to make a bigger string. if we try to run this program,
it'll error out. it's telling us here that we can't add an integer and string
together. you can only add integers to integers and strings to strings. 
so we need to change the variable my_age to a string.

int('432')
float('234.2')
str(592)
str(-3.2)
str(True)
int(True)
int(False)
bool(0)
bool(1)

to cast a value, use the type you want like a command with parenthesis after it.
you can turn numbers into strings, strings into numbers, and you can also
cast 1s and 0s to booleans and vice versa.

int("233.12")
bool(23)
float("hello")

be careful though, because this is an easy way to introduce more errors.

my_age = 24
how_old = str(my_age) + " years old"
print(how_old)

if we go back to that program and cast the integer
to a string, it'll run this time without problems. cool.

okay lastly, let's learn about the input command.
input lets you type something into your program, so
you don't have to change the program every time you run it.

input()

this command will return whatever the user types in.
when i run this program, it'll wait for me to type something in,
and when i hit enter, the program comes to a stop.

you can give the input command a prompt to ask the user of your program.
here's a basic example.

name = input('what is your name?')

print("hello there, " + name + "!")

this program created a variable called 'name', waited for me to type
something in, and then stored it inside of that variable.
it then added that variable to make a bigger string, and printed it out.
awesome. 


wow. that was a lot of information. congrats. but, we still don't know 
how to do very much in python yet. so take a breather, and in the next video, 
we're going to look at a bunch of examples of programs that do things with 
what we just learned.

again, make sure to play around with all of these things on your own. 
coming up with cool programs from the beginning is the mark of a 
skilled programmer. 

alright, code dog out.
