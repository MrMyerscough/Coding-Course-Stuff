today we're going to look at examples of some simple programs
we can make in python. 

as we learn more concepts in python, you can make cooler and 
more complex programs, but all of the ones you can see here 
are pretty short and plain.

so this is a simple math program.
it asks for two numbers and then tells the user the sum,
difference, product, and quotient of the two. pretty simple.

this one divides numbers but gives a fraction remainder
instead of a decimal. it uses floor division and the modulo
operator to get whole number quotient and the remainder.
you can pause to take a closer look at how it works.
