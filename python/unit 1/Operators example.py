"""Unit 1 - Operators
In this example there will be 4 different tasks to complete using operators.
Make sure to run your code in between each task to make sure that program is working correctly before moving on."""

# Task 1: Solve this problem: What is the output of the difference of double the sum of 4 and 7, and 7, divided by 5? 
# Your program should ouput 3 if you coded it correctly.


# Task 2: What is the sum of 4 to the 6th power and 6 to the 4th power?
# Your program should output 5392 if you coded it correctly.



# Task 3: Write a program that takes the users number and adds 5, doubles the previous answer, subtracts 4 from that answer,
# divides that answer by 2, and then subtracts the users entered number. Print the result.
# If you coded it correctly, your program should output 3 no matter what the user enters.



# Task 4: Have the user enter the side length of a square and store it as a variable. Then, find the perimeter of the square.
# If the user enters the square has a side length of 6, the program should output 24 for the perimeter
