video points: *NEEDS REVISION*

*make an introduction, or something, probably*

how to write instructions / commands:

-first type the instruction name, in this case "print"

-a set of parenthesis after the name of the instruction is what tells the
program to run that instruction

-inside the parenthesis put a set of double quotation marks and type something inside 
(we'll type hello world)

-the value or values inside the set of parenthesis is the data you give to that command

-the end of the instruction is the end of the line. when you create a new line, you can
write more commands

-run your program by right clicking and selecting "run code"

-the output is shown in this part, called the terminal

-as you can see, the program has printed exactly what we commanded it to. cool.

-let's go back to the program again. since we know that a program is just a **set** of instructions,
we can type as many "prints" as we want. (go back and print your name, then run the program again)
a second print will do what you'd probably expect

-if your program didn't run, and you have an error, there are a lot of reasons why that might be

-programming languages can be very picky for how they instructions are written. for example,
you can put as many spaces between the command name and the set of parenthesis (demo),
but if you accidentally put a space or tab before the command name, it'll error. 

         print("hello world")

Print("hello world")

print(hello world)

-it also cares about the way you write the command name. it's case-sensitive, so if i type
"print" with a capital "P", the program will error, because it couldn't find a command with that name

-and if i get rid of the quotation marks, the program gets confused again

-different commands take different types of data. this is called a string, which is made up 
of letters and characters

-"print" will also take numbers (demo), expressions, and other values.

-awesome. so know we know how to write commands and give them different kinds of data.

-that's all for this lesson, make sure to play around with your own programs and learn a little on your own
