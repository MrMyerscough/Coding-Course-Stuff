# 4.1 - Functions
# In this practice there will be 4 different tasks to complete using 
# functions. Make sure to run your code in between each task 
# to make sure that the program is working correctly before moving on.

# Task 1: Create a function that prints out some ASCII art. (You can find
# an art generator online.) Call the function twice. 



# Task 2: Create a function that takes in a number as a parameter and 
# prints out that number to the fifth power. Call the function given
# the numbers 3 and 28. (This function should not return, just print 
# on its own.)



# Task 3: Create a function that takes in a list as a parameter and 
# randomly returns an item from that list. Call the function given
# ['cat', 'dog', 'bird', 'hamster'] and print out the returned value. 



# Task 4: Create a function that takes in an age as a parameter. If
# the entered value is less than 18 return 'minor'. Else, if the entered
# value is less than 65 return 'adult'. Else, return 'senior'. Test out
# the function by calling it with different ages and printing the output.
