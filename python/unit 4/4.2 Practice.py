# 4.2 - Advanced Functions
# In this practice there will be 5 different tasks to complete using 
# advanced functions. Make sure to run your code in between each task 
# to make sure that the program is working correctly before moving on.

# Task 1: Create a function that takes in three numbers and returns
# the product of the three. Call the function using keyword arguments,
# and then print out the result.





# Task 2: Create a function that calculates the total cost of an item
# including sales tax. The function will need the subtotal and a tax rate.
# If a tax rate is not provided, default to using a tax of 6%. Remember 
# that you calculate a total by multiplying a subtotal by (1 + (tax rate / 100)). 
# Test the function by providing the subtotal and the rate, and again with only
# the subtotal.





# Task 3: Create a function that will take an unlimited amount of 
# arguments and returns all of the string arguments in a list. Then
# test the function by printing out the returned list.
# hint: use the type() command




# Task 4: Create a function that solves ratio problems. For example
# 12/3 = 9/x. To find the answer, cross multiply the numbers and
# then solve for X. You can use the equation a/b = c/x where 
# x = (b * c) / a. Add proper documentation explaining the parameters 
# for this function using a docstring.



# Task 5: Create a function that takes in a list of numbers, adds 12 to
# each number, and then returns it in a new list. Your function should 
# leave the old list unmodified. Test your function by printing out
# the original list along with the new one.
