""" Unit 4 - Functions - Defining and Calling Functions
In this example there will be 4 different tasks to complete using functions.
Make sure to run your code in between each task to make sure that program is working correctly before moving on."""

# Task 1: Define a function that calculates the percentage of a score out of 30 based on the inputed number.
# If the user enters the score 20, the functions should print 66.666666%



# Task 2: Define a function that asks the user for their name, age, and grade in school, and then prints all of the information
# back to the user. An example output is "Your name is Janelle, you are 18 years old, and you are a senior."




# Task 3: Write a function with parameter "number". When a number is entered into the function, it should print whether the number
# is even or odd, prime or composite, and positive or negative.




# Task 4: Write a function that takes all of your test grades and calculates your average grade in the class, and then returns that value.
# After running this and returning for all 6 variables, write a function that takes your grades and calculates your GPA.
# HINT: 4 point GPA scale: 93-100 - 4.0, 90-92 - 3.7, 87-89 - 3.3, 83-86 - 3.0, 80-82 - 2.7, 77-79 - 2.3, 73-76 - 2.0, 70-72 - 1.7, 
# # 67-69 - 1.3, 65-66 - 1.0, 0-65 - 0.0
