# 5.1 - Classes
# In this practice there will be 5 different tasks to complete using 
# advanced functions. Make sure to run your code in between each task 
# to make sure that the program is working correctly before moving on.

# Task 1: Create a videogame class that takes in a name, year released,
# and price for a videogame. The function where you pass these values
# in should store them inside of the object as properties.





# Task 2: Using that class, create 4 videogame objects of some of your
# favorite games. Store them in four separate variables.





# Task 3: Create a method in the class that prints the object information 
# in a formatted string. For example 'Wii Sports, released 2006 - $20'




# Task 4: Create a method inside of the class that changes the value of 
# the price property. This method should take in a new price value 
# and then change the price property of the object. To verify everything 
# works, change the price of the second and fourth videogames, and then
# call the method you wrote in task #3.
