"""Unit 5 - Creating Classes
In this example there will be 4 different tasks to complete by creating classes.
Make sure to run your code in between each task to make sure that program is working correctly before moving on."""

# Task 1: Create a class called "Books". Creating the __init__ function for this class that defines what this object contains.
# You should include title, author, ISBN number, and number of pages.



# Task 2: Create an object "book_1" using your Books class you created above. Make sure you give the object all of the
# parameters from above (title, author, ISBN, number of pages). Repeat with "book_2" and "book_3"



# Task 3: Print the title of "book_1", the author of "book_2", and the number of pages of "book_3".



# Task 4: Have the user create an object "book_4", where they enter all of the parameters. Then, print each of the book_4 
# parameters to check that the object has been created correctly.
