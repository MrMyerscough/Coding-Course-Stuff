/* Unit 1 - Conditionals
This example will have you completing tasks using conditionals using JS Syntax.
Make sure to run your code in between each task to make sure that program is working correctly before moving on.*/

// Task 1 - Create a program that outputs "The number is even" if the variable 'number' is even, or "The number is odd"
// if the variable is odd.

number = 5

if(number%2 == 0){
    console.log(`${number} is even`)
} else{
    console.log(`${number} is odd`)
}

// Task 2 - Create a program that outputs whether the variable 'number' is greater than 10, less than 10, or equal to 10.

number = 12

if(number > 10){
    console.log(`${number} is greater than 10`)
}else if(number < 10){
    console.log(`${number} is less than 10`)
}else{
    console.log(`${number} is equal to 10`)
